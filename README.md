# Implementation of Regression Algorithms 

Regression is basically a statistical approach to find the relationship between variables. In machine learning, this is used to predict the outcome of an event based on the relationship between variables obtained from the data-set.

There is an implementation of SVM Regressor which is in implementSVM.ipynb file and implementation of RandomForest Regressor is in implementRandomForest.ipynb file (jupyter notebook).
